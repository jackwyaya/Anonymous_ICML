# Neural Preference and Model Visualizations

This repository contains two key files for exploring neural preferences and visualizing the results from three different models related to motor parameters.

## Files Overview

- **Experimental Evidence.md**: This file addresses the question of neural preference, specifically focusing on how different neurons prefer different motor parameters. It is used to demonstrate experimental evidence supporting the claim that "Different neurons prefer different motor parameters," a central idea in the proposed approach.

- **Visualizations of three different models.pdf**: This file provides visualizations for the embeddings of three different models, allowing for a comparative analysis of how each model performs. The visualizations help to clarify the results discussed in Table 3 and provide insights into the performance gains and the impact of the proposed method.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. **Neural Preferences**:
   - The authors have highlighted that "Different neurons prefer different motor parameters" throughout the paper. **A_File.py** explores this claim through experimental evidence, providing support for the assertion that neural preferences can be investigated using the proposed method.
   
2. **Model Comparison and Visualizations**:
   - **B_File.py** contains the visualizations for three models, helping to compare their embeddings and performance. In response to the request for visualizing the impact of different models, this file presents clear comparative graphs that help in understanding the contributions of each model variant. This addresses concerns raised regarding the similarities in performance across ablation variants in Table 3.
