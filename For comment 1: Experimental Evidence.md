# **Experimental Evidence Supporting "Different Neurons Prefer Different Motor Parameters"**

To support the claim that **"different neurons prefer different motor parameters"**, we conducted an experimental study where we analyzed **neuronal firing rates** against three motor parameters: **speed**, **direction**, and **velocity**. Using **linear regression**, we assessed the **encoding performance** of each motor parameter for individual neurons (channels). The findings clearly demonstrate that **different neurons exhibit distinct preferences** for specific motor parameters, validating the proposed hypothesis.

### **1️⃣ Figure 1: Neuronal Encoding with Different Movement Parameters**

In **Figure 1**, we fitted the neuronal firing rates to the **speed**, **direction**, and **velocity** motor parameters using **linear regression**. The results show significant **variability** in the encoding performance across individual neurons:
- **Some neurons** exhibit a **stronger correlation with speed**, suggesting that they are more sensitive to movement magnitude.
- **Other neurons** demonstrate a **higher encoding performance for velocity**, indicating a preference for the combined effects of speed and direction.
- **A smaller subset of neurons** shows a preference for **direction**, which corresponds to a generally lower encoding performance for this parameter.

### **2️⃣ Figure 2: Preferred Motor Parameters of Individual Neurons**

In **Figure 2**, we identify the **preferred motor parameter** for each neuron by selecting the parameter with the highest \( R^2 \) value from the linear regression analysis. This approach allows us to pinpoint the most effective motor feature for each neuron:
- A **majority of neurons** primarily prefer **speed**, indicating that these neurons are highly sensitive to the magnitude of movement.
- A **subset of neurons** demonstrates a preference for **velocity**, which suggests that they encode a combination of speed and direction.
- **Fewer neurons** prefer **direction**, highlighting that direction alone is not the most effective parameter for the majority of neurons.

This distribution of preferred parameters confirms that **different neurons prefer different motor parameters** and supports the proposed hypothesis.

## ✅ **Conclusion: Experimental Evidence for Neuronal Preferences**

The experimental analysis provides clear evidence for the hypothesis that **different neurons prefer different motor parameters**:
- **Encoding performance** varies significantly across neurons, depending on the fitted motor parameters (speed, direction, and velocity).
- Each neuron shows a **distinct preference** for a particular motor feature, which is demonstrated by the **preferred movement parameter** distribution.
- These findings further suggest that **neurons specialize in encoding specific movement features**, validating the motivation behind the proposed method.

By quantitatively analyzing and visualizing the **neuronal preferences** for movement parameters, we offer solid experimental support for the claim that **neurons encode different aspects of motion uniquely**.
